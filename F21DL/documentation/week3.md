# Week 3 Meeting Notes

## Agenda:
1. Dataset Confirmation  
2. Questions for Professor  
3. Upcoming Presentation  
4. Next Steps and To-do Items 

### 1. Dataset Confirmation:
- **Confirmed Datasets:**  
  - **Coffee Table**  
  - **Chocolate Table**  
  - **Fruit Image Dataset**  
- All datasets are from credible sources and are ready for use in the project.

### 2. Questions for Professor:
The following questions will be asked during the next meeting with the professor:
1. Do we need to apply traditional ML algorithms on the **image datasets**, or should we only focus on neural network models?  
2. Should **neural networks** be applied to the **tabular datasets** (Coffee and Chocolate), or are traditional ML algorithms sufficient?

### 3. Upcoming Presentation:
- The group is required to give a **10-minute presentation** on the three datasets:
  - **Coffee**, **Chocolate**, and **Fruit Images**.
- The group will research the structure and content of the presentation, focusing on:
  - Dataset sources and credibility.
  - Preprocessing steps undertaken for each dataset.
  - The proposed machine learning approaches to be mentioned.
  - Potential challenges and solutions in the analysis of each dataset.

  ### 4. Next Steps:
- **Research Content for Presentation:**  
  Group members will individually research the datasets, the machine learning models, and key points for the presentation.

  ## Next Meeting:
- Friday, after the lab slot.
