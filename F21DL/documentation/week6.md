# Week 4 Meeting notes

## 1. Data Preprocessing

- **Overall Focus**: Continued implementing various data preprocessing steps.
- **Tasks Accomplished**:
- Minha and Eman focused on the chocolate dataset with similar steps:
    - Conducting extra preprocessing steps and experimenting with feature engineering.
- Faiz and Mahak focused on the chocolate dataset with similar steps:
    - conducted attribute selection.
  - Arjun continued to reseach more on pre-processing steps for image dataset.


## 2. Clustering Algorithms

- **Overall Focus**:Implemented and evaluated multiple clustering techniques on the coffee quality dataset to uncover natural groupings within the coffee attributes.
- **Tasks Acoomplished**:
  - Faiz worked on the coffee dataset containing altitude features.
  - Mahak focused on the coffee dataset without altitude features.
  - Hierarchical Clustering: Conducted Agglomerative Clustering on standardized data, utilizing Ward linkage and Euclidean distance.
  - Tested a range of cluster numbers (2 to 7) to analyze variations in cluster quality.
  - Assessed clustering outcomes using silhouette scores to evaluate cluster cohesion and separation.
  - Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM): Applied GMM for probabilistic clustering, which accounts for overlapping clusters.
  - Evaluated clustering models with BIC and AIC criteria, alongside silhouette scores, for a comprehensive comparison.
  - Clusters were visualized using PCA projections, allowing for clearer insights into cluster separability.

## 3. Upcoming Week's Focus

- **Plans**:
  - Focusing to performing a few more clustering algorithms on coffee dataset and chocolate dataset.
  - Implementing and comparing various classification ML models.
  - Schedule follow-up meetings to assess progress and implement changes.
  - Continue development and refinement of datasets and analysis.
  - Prepare for the next milestone in project development.
