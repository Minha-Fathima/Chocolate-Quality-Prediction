# Week 4 Meeting notes

## 1. Clustering Algorithms

- **Overall Focus**:Implemented and evaluated multiple clustering techniques on the coffee and chocolate quality dataset to uncover natural groupings within the coffee attributes.
- **Tasks Acoomplished**:
  - Faiz and Mahak worked on the coffee dataset.
  - Minha and Eman worked on the chocolate dataset.
  - For chocolate dataset:
    - K-means clustering: conducted K-means clustering on standardized data and assessed the optimal number of      clusters using Elbow method.
    - DBScan: Conducted DBScan Clustering on standardized data.
    - Tested a range of cluster numbers (2 to 7) to analyze variations in cluster quality.
    - Assessed clustering outcomes using silhouette scores to evaluate cluster cohesion and separation.

## 3. Upcoming Week's Focus

- **Plans**:
  - Focusing to performing clustering algorithms on chocolate dataset.
  - Focus on starting baseline models for a classification problem such as Decision Trees, Naive Bayes etc.
  - Implementing and comparing various classification ML models.
  - Schedule follow-up meetings to assess progress and implement changes.
  - Continue development and refinement of datasets and analysis.
  - Prepare for the next milestone in project development.
