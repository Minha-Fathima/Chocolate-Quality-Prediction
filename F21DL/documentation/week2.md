# Week 2 Meeting Notes

## 1. Topic Confirmation
- **Food Quality**
- The group confirmed the use of an image dataset for predicting the quality of fruits. This will be used for tasks such as CNN & other visual classification techniques.
- The group is still searching for a suitable quantitative dataset with measurable attributes (e.g., chemical composition, moisture levels, etc.) to complement the image dataset and provide numerical data for quality prediction.

- **Player/Team Forecasting**
Possible Dataset Options:
- F1 or FIFA datasets were discussed as potential options.
- Further exploration is required to find more relevant datasets for this objective.

## 2. Action Items
- **GitHub Setup:**
  - Group members need to set up SSH keys for their GitHub profiles to ensure secure access.
  - All members should connect their GitHub repositories with VS Code for seamless project integration.
- **Dataset Search:**
  - Continue searching for a quantitative dataset for the **Quality Prediction** project.
  - Explore additional options for player/team forecasting beyond the F1 and FIFA datasets.

  ## Next Meeting:
